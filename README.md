# Banking Website

This is to showcase some more advanced DOM manipulation and event handling/delegation/propagation, together with some visual components as part of a SPA. Whilst I could have used 3rd party libraries for large portions of the code, the aim was to write this myself, thus allowing me to learn more about DOM manipulation at a granular level.

Some key, visual, aspects of the site include:

- implementing smooth scrolling
- building tabbed components
- implementing sticky navigation
- lazy loading images
- slider components
